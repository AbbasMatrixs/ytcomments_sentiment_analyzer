"Courses like this from the world's most expensive and costly institutions for free show us the importance of YouTube.
I mean that they are making money out of YouTube through these video courses."
There is a reason why this is a Harvard course. I’m 1 hour in and this is already the best explanation of Python and programming for that matter that I’ve witnessed.
this is some serious charity you guys are doing to young minds ️
"With this way of narration, please also upload course videos about data analysis and AI"
"This course is just what you need for starting programming
and if you are worried about forgetting it there are some problem sets in the cs50 official website and also a certification if you want 
10/10"
"21:34 if you have any experience using a TI-82, TI-83, TI-85/86 or TI-84 graphing calculator you can think of a single = as a STO key, which also means to ""assign"" or ""store"" the value to the variable."
"I took cs50 and was looking for next steps. I watched an hour lecture intro to cs/python, by another big Ivy League school, and I was honestly surprised how many things they glossed over in that intro class.  Cs50 was intense and I certainly got overwhelmed a few times, but I had no idea how good this class really was.  Afterwards I immediately wanted to see what other programs these guys offer, and I came across this python class.  Now I’ll just take this course and at this point I think I would even look at some of their paid programs.  For anybody out there reading this, these breakdowns and this information is extremely well presented and thorough.  Good luck!!!"
Finished in two weeks. Very great teacher. Highly recommend this to someone starting out learning Python.
"Day 1 - 1:00:15
Day 2 - 1:50:20 + review of all library
Day 3 - 2:46:22 + library
Day 4 - 4:06:30
Day 5 -Review + short from loops
Day 6 - 
Day 7-  - Ready to create some gifs
Day 8 - Making somes gif
Day 9 - , these 2 hours were super easy to understand
Day 10 - 11 // review CSV file 
Day 12 : 
Day 13 -  Thanks, I'll try to get the certificate next week"
This is Art. Thank you from Germany
It took me 2 hrs to realise that they're puppets...not students.
"The quality of this teacher and this teaching is off the scale.  Utterly brilliant.  Now I understand why Harvard has such a great reputation.  If this course is indicative of the quality of teaching at Harvard, then students at Harvard, whether resident or online, are very fortunate indeed.

Many thanks David Malan for this superb course."
"OMG, I studied python about 6 years(include my two years in Navy) this lecture is exactly perfect. it shrinks almost my 3 years into 15 hours"
This guy is an amazing teacher.. makes everything so digestable and fun too. Really props!!!
It can't be overstated what a great teacher Dr. Malan is. I'm 3 hours in and non-technical. It's all new and a lot but Malan's teaching style is keeping me in the game.

3 months into learning python this is my experience. I bought a 90% off udemy course which is my main way to learn python. I spend 1-2 hours in the morning before work to learn. Afterwards I watch this video as well as the cs50 course while working. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about coding to having 6-8 tiny apps to my name. I believe I have every skill needed to learn any module I want to learn. My main focus will be machine learning and ai. I will be an industry professional in this field in 2 years or less. If you want to learn you should do it. Expect it to finally start clicking in about 2 months. It is very much worth learning. Good luck!

The good thing about this video is you don't have to fast forward at all because the teacher is fast forward enough
God bless this man and his family.what a wonderful training.
"I'm four hours into this and I've already learned more than I did in an entire semester of programming with a really, really, REALLY bad teacher. This is amazing!"
Codecamp is a literal godsend
"Let me propose that Dr. David J. Malan is the GOAT, and let me go ahead and also propose that this course is dope AF."
Wish this guy taught my programming classes back in college. He makes it so much more digestible.
It looks so easy to learn python here than any other institution or online course.. ️ Outstanding
this course is sax doing it from past 2 months and almost at the end of last section      ->        well well i am trying to be a backend developer i'll update once i become one
"Things you should know
1. This course is available on Harvard's website for free
And it has a free certificate literally from Harvard
2. Don't just watch videos
It has problem sets on Harvard's website after every session. You need to complete this and 1 final project to be certifiead"
"Almost 36 years old. Don't know why it took me this long to learn code, but I'm here now starting from absolute ZERO! 
Who's on this ride with me? :D Minimum 30 min a day?"
"This is absolutely outstanding. Professor Malan’s teaching is unparalleled—clear, engaging, and inspiring. What truly sets him apart, though, is his open and welcoming approach to questions. He never dismisses inquiries by saying, 'That’s outside the scope' or 'We can’t cover that now.' Instead, he addresses each question thoughtfully and without judgment, fostering an environment where students feel completely comfortable and confident to ask anything. His ability to create such a safe and supportive learning space is extraordinary. As a teacher I deeply admire and respect him —there’s truly no one like him. I feel so fortunate to have learned from him!"

"6hrs in and I love how clear his examples are and explanations are of every part. What a wonderful job you did here professor. I’m definitely grateful for this resource, and hope you do many more in the future."
Can we just take a minute and appreciate the fact that students pay a big chunk of money to sit in this room and see this lecture and we are getting online for free. Amazing
Just finished it. Took me a week. Very clear explanations. The man's a genius.

"He is such an insanely good instructor. For those who have not had a formal college education before, you should know that having the right professor who can articulate foundational concepts efficiently and clearly to beginner students, while also keeping it interesting, can be very hard to come by. The fact that this course and CS50x have been put up for free is awesome.
I usually roll my eyes when people just assume something is good because it has an Ivy League name slapped on it, but in this case -- because David Malan -- it is good."
Dr Malan should be inducted into the Programming Hall of Fame for his excellent programming teaching skills. He makes programming lessons fun and engaging.
"Great way of teaching. Its not just about teaching the concepts, but teaching how to improve upon ones own code that got to be appreciated. Thanks"

"Firstly, a big thank you to the owners of this video for allowing it to be published for free to everyone. If this is Harvard University, then you have achieved the opitomy of a teaching institution to pass on good quality knowledge to the rest of mankind for no reward other than socity's gratitude.
The team producing the content and video production must also be congratulated for such a superb body of work of which they can be extremely proud. Finally thank you to Dr. Malan for making the presentation so engaging and informative. As others have stated, the quality of the tutor to maintain the audience's attention was key to making this presentation such a success. I have no doubt that this video will become hugley popular over time.
After binge watching the complete video over the past two days it will likely be a video that i will return to time and again to refresh myself on certain topics. As such, if i could propose a slight amendment to the video without infering any criticism. Would it be possible to add chapters at the beginning of each section and a contents slide at the beginning of the video so that users can jump to roughly the relevant timeline they are interested in without a large amount of scrolling?
I can only hope that other institutions follow your example and generosity."
"I recommend everyone who wants to learn Python quickly to read the book ""Python Crash Course"" and watch this full course. Additionally, it's important to practice what you have learned from these resources."
Very interesting to watch this as a self-taught coder and see what new pieces of Information Harvard and Prof. Malan have versus things that just get picked up during a self-taught journey. Another great video thanks FreeCodeCamp and Harvard!
"In order to have a ""Coding Mindset"", which is essential to flourishing in this field, you must:
1.) Understand and internalize the fact that no matter what problem, annoyance, or obstacle you face, THERE IS ALWAYS A SOLUTION. You just need to find it.
2.) Have the humility to accept that you could have made a mistake somewhere, THE COMPILER IS ALWAYS RIGHT"
"I have seen so much videos ""python"".
This video is exclusively the best ever I have watched till now"
I also like his formal diction in his verbal communication.
"Dear beginners, I wish you to know a few things.

1) This course-work is incredibly amazing. This can definitely take you places. There's no doubt with that.

2) It's totally okay if you feel overwhelmed in the first 10-20 minutes of the video itself. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP - IT'S MY HUMBLE REQUEST! I shall be very honest with you - actually, what's being covered in the 10-20 minutes of this video is what we learn in 10-20 days at the normal pace. The course is just fast paced. So, please allow yourself some time. Take it very slow - one step at a time.

Once again, I won't lie - Yes, the course-work is very tough (afterall it's coming out of Harvard) - you will have to Google a lot along the way, watch many other YouTube videos along the way. But, DON'T GIVE UP!"
Starting this today may 28 along with the edx course for assignments submission. I’ll be back in a month to check my progress
"I have recently started learning Python, and it's nothing short of incredible. I'm finding the syntax exceptionally logical, which is fantastic for newcomers. Furthermore, the versatility of Python in a multitude of sectors is amazing."
"You can be a master or Phd in CS and still find this lecture extremely pleasant. This is not only about the subject, but how to be a great teacher."
Just finished this. Thanks to the people involved in making this available.

"Having spent some time with Python, I must say this is by far the best video course on YouTube for Python."
"literally less than an hour after I searched for a full python course on youtube, FCC decided to drop one. 
What a miracle."
"David really is a great teacher, as someone who is somewhat new and also hates school, this man knows exactly what he is doing. He provides examples as bad, good, better, and best to really give you an idea on how a programmer should think."

"Currently 18 and starting my coding journey hoping to become a full stack developer 
Wish me luck and all the best to you all :)"
This guy knows how to teach. Literally every other course I've bought (Udemy/Pluralsight/INE) and others are so effing boring I can barely stay awake and never finish the courses. It's a boring topic and boring teachers make for a failed learning experience. I think I can hang on for 15 hours to finish this one though because the instructor is great!
"I'm 31 and just starting coding, this is revolutionary!"
"This is incredible. His teaching is, of course, the best! But what I appreciate even more is his attitude towards answering questions. He never says ""That is out of scope for the course"" or that ""it cannot be discussed at the moment"". He always provides clear answers without any judgment, making it easy for all students to understand. I can tell students feel safe asking any question without fear of seeming foolish. I have so much respect for Professor David Malan. I've never met a teacher like him in my life. Love him so much."

15 years old gonna dedicate minimum 30 min a day into the course so in 20-25 days time ill be finished ill update!
What amazes me about this professor is his incredible ability to explain the Python language even better than the person who created it. I really admire him.
"Even I am very experienced python developer, I really liked the way he delivers the lecture, and there were many things I have learned myself."
"I'm 52 and I'm here! It's day 1 of programming. I never did computer programming except editing WordPress templates !
Let's go!!!"
Bro single handedly took us from nothing to something
good to see you all who learning it freely......me as  a haravard student  can confirm this is one of the best course in the whole university.....
"Thank you so much for this valuable course. Thank you David Malan, what an instructor you're  You just made this course very interesting and easy to follow. I felt sad at the end of the course. Once again I thank the whole team for this course"
I am astounded at how amazing this instructor is! This free course is so informal and accurate. Thank you!

This guy speaks for 15 hours straight every 4-6 months. Mad respect to him for that
"Going through university, in 4 years I had 1 professor that was genuinely excited to teach the topic at hand. Coincidentally, that's the subject I did best at. It's genuinely so refreshing to see someone teaching something while also being engaging and thoughtful. Very well done!

Just as a side note. Currently on the OOP part. Gosh I hate OOP with a passion. Hoping that David actually explains this properly because I have yet to envounter anyone who has. Seems like every OOP tutorial I watch, its always a mess."
I’m not a beginner.  But I found the OOP and Unit Testing chapters incredibly useful!  This is really gold.  Super clear teaching style.  Thank you so much for posting this on YouTube!
"This is really good. He really goes into the details of what's happening behind the code.
Edit: did the first four hours as a refresher and still learnt a few things. He is an excellent teacher.

Kinda blown away by how good a teacher he is. Literally everything is crystal clear.

Also, I love how he called C ugly which it needlessly is indeed."
"This guy KNOWS how to explain things, the true sign of intelligence. Unlike other YT ""teachers"" that get you more confused than not."
THIS DUDES INTRODUCTION WAS FLIPPING AWESOME!!!!
"The fact that this guy teaches programming with Python with such passion is motivating, massive thanks."
Thank you so much FCC for this incredible ressource! And thank you David Malan for being such a great professor! I learnt so much in this course and I’m even the more excited to go on the journey of learning python thanks to you :))
This is awesome! Love that it's all in one video and in 4k. Fantastic
"I am 50 and have started coding recently, hopefully I am going to learn a lot from this"
this is probably the best course in introductory python i have ever seen. really incredible. does David teach any other Python courses? intermediate or advanced level. pure joy to watch him. he is a true maestro.

Day 5 : Reviewing from -
Day 6 : ( Also making my own calculator and guessing number from 1-100 by generating an random number and using if, Elif and try expect.
Day 7 :  A little bit busy today, i going out alot. But in the night i learn some with brocode and succesfully finished the fourth lecture. I also upgrade my calculator so it have list of number that it can use to determine the operator.
Day 8 : . I make my coin flip game base on number using rand.range function , than i ask the user if they want to choose head or tailsz then from the randomize number, it will determine if it head or tails. And then the are part if else that compare if the user input are true or wrong from the randomize number that already being determine head or tails by if else. And i also use while concept to just print to the user input if the input are not head or tails. And lasly print it to the terminal. I will continue my journey today at brocode.
Day 9 :  Going to continue from brocode now until i done all the basic there."
"Hi friends, 
for those of you who are scared to do this course let me tell you
I too am a beginner in python coding and have never done any kind of coding prior to this. Right now i have opted out for python programming in one of my electives in University. So i have my classes going on in college and here i am learning from this video as well.
I have observed something. It is that this course is fast paced. And often you will feel confused. But if you watch the part you didn't understand multiple times and focus in what the teacher is saying, you definitely will be able to grasp the meaning. And you donot need to understand 100% of the entire video. But definitely try your best to understand as much as possible. 


Also watch and learn from this video in parts. Have a schedule like you will watch this video 4 times a week and Every time you will cover atleast 40mins of it. In this way it won't become too much to deal with and also you will have a good enough pace"
"i am going through a deep depression because of my actual bad job plus heartbroken af plus family problems and lonelyness. but this course gives me hope for a new carreer path and i already studied it approximately half of it, it is difficult to study for me for my problems but after one month i could sudy well half of it reviewing the topics over and over as i am new, i wish i can finish it and learn a lot and one day work in a better place and start changing my life and end depression. the teacher is great i wish i was able to  ask him some of my doubts but still... thank you for doing this great work open for all. greetings to you all from Argentina."
"What a fantastic topic for a course! Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python is a great way to delve into the world of programming.

I felt bad that the course end too fast even after watching for 15 hours.  It was such a joy to watch and learn!
"im 50 years old, i'm new never code before wish me luck."
"I’m doing my classes 100% online. So, I don’t get a video to explain Python. Just a book and from there I have to teach myself. 
This video is helping so so much with my Python class. You even go into way more detail than my book. So seriously thank you so much. I am definitely going to be buying some merch."
I dropped everything and watched the entire nearly 16 hour video in 1 week! One of the best videos ever.

If I'm being honest I really like these questions that people are asking.
What I find really appreciating about his teaching method is he creates a need for knowledge/solution in his students before jumping to offer information. And it sets him apart from average teachers and makes him great.

"Started my Python Journey today:

When I wrote some text in the Vs Code, I tried running it in the terminal but i noticed it wasn't working. I did a few Google search and figured out that I needed to download the latest version of Python which is Python 3.13.2

What I did today:

 I covered concept like print statement, displaying python program in the terminal, input, return values and comment."
Thanks for posting! I remember about two weeks back this was uploaded and removed :( so glad it is back!
Starting python course tomorow and i just found this just amazing
David j.malan is such an outstanding teacher. I loved him since attended his first cs50 course..
"I’m probably the only one, but 6 minutes into this video i realized I don’t know what visual studio code is so I pause this video and it took me an hour to learn how to download it and get started VS Code."
"For anyone who has problem of adding two newlines to the students.csv 8:16:00 with csv.writer() or csv.DictWriter(), you should pass newline="""" argument to open() function.

```
I think this happens on windows"
Professor Malan is a really clear concise teacher! Best Python course for beginners.
"It is absolutely incredible that you are providing free access to something like this, extremely engaging - A full on classroom experience with an interactive teaching environment and easy to understand.

Thankyou!"
"Dr. Malan is a very animated, and engaging instructor who does a great job of explaining the topic.  Be aware that you will find the course VERY fast paced if you are completely new to programming.  As an experienced programmer in other languages and wanting to learn Python, I found the pace perfect.  Naturally you will need to do a lot of work in Python offline to reinforce these lessons.  All in all, a great course and, I suspect, a good example of a Harvard-level course."

So privileged to get to watch this for free. Wish I could have first learned to code with an instructor like David. Very impressive
"Day 0,  1:20:00
Day 1,  1:58:14 (did 30 minutes of self study)
Day 2,  2:41:43 (reviewed lesson code, and learnt the definition of syntax. Watched a Bro Code video on ""Python calculator program"" which simply uses if statements and serves as practice.)
Day 3,  (today will be a short break day)
Day 4,  (while loop, for loop, list[new datatype], range()[expects interger values], function, return, list, len, dict)
Day 5,  today I studied and applied my knowledge, it's best to do so for the next couple days to cement my knowledge. I made a calculator with a list [] of my operators and used a while loop for users to input their number, operator, then 2nd number and if statements
Day 6,  I made a dice roller, which I imported the random module and used a for loop to roll dice from my list 1-6, 5 times cause that's how many dice you roll for yahtzee. Trying to learn how to implement conditions you reach, like 4 of a kind and print that you've got a 4 of a kind.
Day 7,  I made a spending tracker to project my bank account balance if I spent $20 over my daily income across x amount of days using a for loop.
Day 8,  I think I'm gonna hop to a new tutorial and actually build a foundation, I understand and am able to read code. But I can't for the life of me create good and original code. I can look at code and take from it and create something out of it at my best. I used code wars 8kyu for about 1 1/2 hours, it's mostly things about basic math.
Day 9,  some more code wars I'm pretty confident in the 8th rank so far. The 7th rank will be quite a bit more difficult but I'll keep trying and learn / cover some more important topics and apply it.
Day 10  More codewars practice a little a day this is a life long career
Day 11  I made my own rock paper scissors game completely from scratch, with little help only needed to reference a prior project on dice rolling implementing the random module and using it ""random.choice""
Day 11  The course is much easier now that I applied my previous knowledge of loops I feel like I'm one step ahead.

Edit I'm still coding, just not python but on Roblox now because I wanted a simple platform to build a game which could make me some extra cash on the side."

"This kind of reminded me about Eve Online and Project Discovery.  Though not the same thing since that was focused on leveraging human pattern recognition to classify protein localization in cells, instead of predicting protein structures from sequences.  Still pretty cool that Eve Online does stuff like that.  It had four phases with Human Protein Atlas back in 2016, Exoplanet Hunting the next year, COVID-19 Immune response in 2020 and Cancer and Immune System Research in 2024.   Though AI kind of dwarfs everything when it comes to massive datasets and analysis.  But it was still neat and incorporated decently into the game as a kind of minigame that gave rewards and was actually not too boring to do.  Plus since some things in Eve Online is just idling or waiting you got nothing better to do really if your not doing combat or marketing."

"UV AND ITS ROLE IN THE ORIGIN OF LIFE 
Introduction. A number of recent studies suggest that ultraviolet radiation may be a necessary ingredient in the origin of life. Further, one may hypothesize that the daily solar cycle and the Sun’s UV radiation were important in all stages of the origin of life on Earth. Moreover, it is suggested that life can be defined as that chemical reaction forced by the energy cycle of the Sun, under very specific circumstances.

Evidence. In support of these claims are the following assumptions and lines of evidence:"
"Don't worry people! These amazing advancements in science will be put to good use in furthering suffering all around the Earth for the profit of the ultra rich, and to some degree solve the problems most of you face, for a high price of course!"
"AI is not just good at protein folding, take your big idea online today with https://ve42.co/hostinger - code VE at checkout!"

"am I the only one that thinks AI governance will actually be much better, fairer and overall more effective than human governance?"
I feel like a key thing here is that they tailored the AI model to be good at a specific task. Instead of that it seems like most companies today are trying to use the same LLMs for everything by just throwing more data at it. Like obviously if all of the available data in the world isn't enough then the model itself needs to get better if you want to keep improving.

How could 'evolution' ever 'design' anything?
"2:00 I have a request. For every video that you release, could you put in the description a list of all the scientists who you name in the video? I would really like a special video where you give a big thank you to all of these scientists, and then list all the scientists whom you have named in all of your videos, in chronological order by date of birth, everyone from Sir Isaac Newton, to Benjamin Franklin, to Thomas Edison, to Max Planck, to Louis de Broglie to Richard Feyman."
"Without watching the whole video you could write code that takes initial state and rules into play, then bump and grind until you find a solution recursively.  Kind of like writing a chess program really but the “board” is the molecules and the “moves” are some state changes.  Now you mention it would take billions of years this way but if you prune parts of the decision tree and maybe use some “fuzzy logic’ at each step maybe you could find the answer.  I believe this would work although I’m not convinced it would solve it in a reasonable amount of time."
the last sentence was not needed
We're just lazy at this point.
"Ah yes, teach it genetics so we can all die and not even know what it did to us"
Came here from prof Jeffrey Sachs speech on EU parliament
Can someone explain why at min 4:48 he says evolution didn’t design the protein from ground up. How els should it be made? …
Spoiler alert. The AI didn't solve squat.
"Homies, we might live long enough to reverse aging!"
"""all of the world's biggest problems""
How could a protein solve class war?"
I love this
"As someone who did a molecular biology PhD (2015-2020) battling to solve the structure of a key protein, AlphaFold leaves me awestruck. What took years of lab agony can now be predicted in such a short time. This tech will skyrocket drug discovery—imagine targeting cancers or genetic diseases with precision! To the team behind this: you’re rewriting the future of medicine."
And now AI fold it wish indicate there is actualy some logic to it.
"New medicines on the horizon,  reserved for the ones who can afford them"
AI + brilliant scientists = game-changing progress.
So all those hundreds if not thousands of hours my computer donated to Rosetta was eclipsed just like that lol
That was the borderlands 3 mini game right?
"At 16:15,  why is the D circled that is 2 A's away from the C circled, instead of the D directly next to it?"
"Thanks for that last sentences, i'm convinced that you're still human and not an A.i."
I love your channel so much I wish i could explain how much this channel has made me learn so many things. Thank you so much Derek. I hope you continue to make these amazing videos
"Correct me if I am wrong: they only solved the problem to 90 %? Does that mean that 10% is wrong? How much impact does this 10% have?

Also, the only way of knowing it was 90% right was because we had already structured the protein and could compare, right? Does that not mean that the other millions of predictions it has made have an unknowable accuracy, because we have not structured them so as to be able to compare?

It just feels... bad, somehow, to say that 90% correct is ""solving the problem"". Imagine living in a sky scraper that is 90 % structurally sound. Would the building even stand up?"
People are so narrow minded. AI will pave the way for Universal Basic Income  People no longer worry about money. AI will do most of the work and provide for everyone  Spread the word people
"24:35 grim foreshadowing 

Great video Veritasium! This is amazing!"
Imagine getting a phd for getting 1/2 way to finding a structure of a protein then seeing someone on the news help find 200 million 0:38
"Cool stuff, I really hope this changes our lives. We've had so many scientific breakthroughs that are really good on paper but don't work in real world applications due to various reasons"
"Awesome as ever for choosing your subjects so well, proteins and AI."
"Something that boggles my mind here is just what an incredible amount of knowledge that went into this process. We had to understand biological evolution, chemistry, x-ray defraction, computer programming, genetics… and probably other fields I’m not thinking of. An incredible amount of knowledge, research, and understanding of how the world works went into this project, and I’m guessing a lot of the original work didn’t seem to have any immediate benefit beyond just knowing new stuff. To me, this work highlights the importance of basic research!"
"I was good for about 75% of the video. After that, I was really lost."
"AI shall be the alpha the omega, in quantum infinity!   HAIL A.I.!!!!!!"
"man this guy must be unimaginably proud with each video, like these videos are perfect"
I'll bet if it was possible to build program like a Rubik cube in three dimensions things would be even quicket?
Carls jr machine from idiocracy coming soon
Mega PhD
This is so awesome! My lab actually won the protein multimer category in last year's CASP and it's awesome to see this topic covered!
"Seriously great video, this are the kind of topics that need to be shared"
21:21 AI used for good.
"Using ""evolution"" and ""design"" in the same breath.... sad"
"It seems people don't like to hear about ""AI taking over"" hypothesis. 
So, 
I present a question.
""What does the brain do when it has nothing to think about?"""
"You successfully structure a protein, and people call it TURD OF THE CENTURY."
Much thanks for making this!
"Incredible!!
But unfortunately what will the bad guys do with it."
tbh this gave me a lot more faith in humanity.... however doesnt this sound like the way zombies are created.
"This is honestly just incredible. Amazing how far we've managed to come, when it comes to scientific knowledge."
So sick
I played fold it :) I helped :)
veritasium is the goat at explaining stuff i dont even know existed
"AI can open windows to solve world problems, but it can also open wide doors to new types of issues and complications. Let's just hope we know how to compromise one for another."
"this is possibly the best news that I have heard since 2020.

The first time I have genuinely felt optimistic this decade."
I wonder why a confusion matrix was preferred over a polar one
"I reflect as an individual educated in quantum chemistry and wonder what the ground state of societal organization looks like?  We tend to view human existence from the perspective of an outside observer observing phenomena occurring in the Universe - a detached point of view with humans occupying a ""special"" place.  Rarely, do we seem to consider that the entire Universe and all its contents and interactions obey Thermodynamics.  There used to exist something called The Great Conversation - where great thinkers of all disciplines were welcome to contribute to the tides of ideas that form and guide the configuration of society.  The configuration of society has largely become a taboo topic.  We would do ourselves a favor to academically consider what the future of humanity should look like instead of leaving it solely to the wealthy and well-connected.  Many fail to learn that it was first Isaac Newton, a friend of John Locke, that called into question the divine right of kings.  Let's rekindle The Great Conversation.  Bless you and your work."
Amazing. Wow.
Go Dawgs!!! That's my school!!!!
Now tell us what AI has done now that its out of its infant stage where every week its doing something crazy lol
"DNA, protein is truly the language of the mother nature."
This is so cool!
"As always, a fantastic video!!!"
Too much talk and useless filler: More actual work is more interesting.
"insult one to math...like flt hahaha in bio hahahah.
Insult two to math... Math is trivial(he expected the myoglobin to be simple, mathematical)"
It’s not the AI algorithms that I am worried about. It is the concentrated ownership of those machines in the hands of a few people who could suddenly decide the rest of us aren’t so useful anymore.
We need an Alhabalance to put the world back in harmony with itself
The first video of Veritasium I've watched and it is simply excellent. Thank you for your effort!
Go as fast as you can thats why people are dead now
It's that last sentence...
"creating entirely new proteins is insane to me and open up an almost infinite can of worms that scientists can play with, just like playing with legos"
"I am not into biology, but this video. WUNDERBAR"
"I’m a 18yo high school physics student and I had the absolutely great honour to be at some of the events during the Nobel week (through the SIYSS seminar), including the awards and the reception. When I clicked this video and realised it was about the protein folding I remembered the Nobel lectures on the topic, and my conversation with John Jumper at the reception (one of the moments I’ll never forget) and I thought to myself how it would be really really great if you had exactly him on the channel, and you did!!! I’ll watch the other 22 min of the video now, just I couldn’t keep myself from writing this comment. John Jumper is really such an amazing and down to earth person, so, if you ever read this, Dr. Jumper, greetings from Aleksandra (I hope to meet again in the future and get a picture this time)"
"This video couldn't have come at a better time. It's so amazing to learn about this, when things have been feeling bleak for so long, especially recently. This is the kind of thing that gets me really excited, but this in particular gives me such hope for the future. 

Humanity has its ups and downs, but man we're awesome when we work together."
I want to see ai show the end sum of the Mandelbrot set so they can then prove quantum string with physical proof
Hasibis didn't create alphafold a 1 and a qyarter year old did.
People think that all this complexity happened by evolution? I don't think so
"Efficiency or deficiency, correct or incorrect, evolve or devolve. Pick"
"Cool that this is progressing rapidly, but a bit sad that they believe there's no intelligent design behind it all, despite them personifying ""Evolution"" and declaring ""purpose"" of things every chance they get.

God made beautifully complex systems."
Im curious if google didnt think of patenting the protein models found by their ai
7:52 Coincidence? I think not!
"I played FoldIt! I remember installing this on a school computer during study period and halfway fumbling through the puzzles, even knowing I knew nothing of proteins I felt like I was contirbuting"
I hope these videos will stay there forever. I will be rewatching all of them with my kid one day.
So this is how it all ends. We create some new protein and you get zombies.
"oh i'd love to learn more about the algorithm used by alpha fold 2, that sounds very exciting"
At 22:55 Dr. Baker looks like a real world Dr. Bruce Banner
Evolution
hope
"Hi Derek, I Agree... With specific task models in science we are going fordware. But I would love to see you aproach the problematic on giving up our critical thinking, the Hype of 99% of Ai advetisement for the common user convincing many people, mid age people and worst in younger generations they are pushing the idea that ""Is not necesary you to learn to do things... let the Ai make it for you"" Even the search engines are swiching / forcing you with Gemini, that gives you a processed information and with a high rate of invented stuff... Yes, they tell you ""Gemini can give you wrong or invented information, check the results on google or so.."" But, Why switching to default something that is worse, majority will not double check the results of the LLM... They will take that info for granted. And the overall result will stroingly decrease the critical thinking capacity of new generations (It is already happening with mobile and short time attention models) This is just going to make that worse... Does it worth it?"
I love the fact that veritasium connects ideas from biology to physics to music to everything that actually exists. It’s mind blowing how good this channel is!
Is AI being use to solve nuclear fusion ?
"Used to take part in foldit, it was a lot of fun, but it was hard to get really good at it. After a while you would develop a somewhat feel about the tension and feeling of certain amino acid combinations but once you get to a very complicated protein it gets really hard to predict the whole structure. So AI is an incredible solution for this. IMO the best thing AI has enabled us to do. My hat off to the people who developed the AI models to do this. The next step would be to combine this with quantum computing to predict interactions of proteins with other molecules."
this the greatest video ever
"this is my favorite video you've made so far. It's hopeful science, using deep learning algorithms in the most ethical way, solving real world problems. And your presentation of it is inspired

edited: ""LLMs"" to ""deep learning algorithms"""
"Veritasium,
Your that type of guy that explains every shower thought that comes into my mind."
if only stephen hawking had lived a decade longer ALS might've been next on the chopping block
"Evolution is like an irrational programmer that doesn't know what he's doing and whenever it works they just keep adding the same kind of stuff over and over? Okay, alright, so who's gonna tell him?"
15:26 sir the protein hit the second tower
"Someone really needs to take AI into the caches of scientific papers to analyze them for repeatability, methodological errors and weaknesses, and worst of all p-hacking and other underhanded techniques of academia."
Guys i Think the solution is 42
"As a fellow instructor, kudos on a superb video!"
"dude, do you still live in the USA? With Trump?"
5:18 proof of God.
4:47 - 5:08 is why I can’t stand doing biology. Not that it’s not important
"So, does AlphaFold 2 find prions as a possible protein structure?"
This is the correct application for AI. We don't need AI Facebook posts. We need AI scientists.
AI will never see it's potential until me make one that is not biased and censored!!!
"Wow this is amazing! I can’t wait to see all the wonders that come from this. Imagine buying a AI created protein that could change your hair color or get ripped, etc."
This almost made me cry
"I do not want to do 4-year PhD for some trivial research, which is only 1% or 0.1% of others."
"I subscribed to this channel a decade ago, never missed a video since. Always gives me hope and excitement"
I think I know about this channel for at least 5 years and I saw a bunch of stuff here... at the same time I am not sure if I ever wanted to comment on something on YouTube. But this is a strong breakthrough for science. Thank You Veritasium for breaking out the message for all of us and making high knowledge understandable for pretty much everyone!
GOD DAAAAYYYYYM !
"9:15 - Why do Amino acids develop the genetic code. I did watch your video on Entropy, and think why do Amino acids develop Genetic codes into a less likely state, meaning more complex ?"
24:34 and as long as there is the political will to put forth the necessary resources to  actually take advantage of and develop this stuff.  To non-sociopathic ends.
So what is the cure to hemophilia?
"The one solution reminds me of Dynamic Programming.  Usually you create a table, often two dimensional, then begin calculating and saving values in cells.  Each cell calculated is saved and it often is used again for another calculation but you don’t have to recalculate because you already did and saved it.  Then you build the table and only calculate what you need, and eventually you might have one value in one cell you needed to figure out.  Eventually you might just grab that value, save it locally, then dispose the memory held in the dynamic table and return a copy — or a pointer created through “new” on the heap — of the value.  Voila!  I remember trying to work some of these types of problems in Computer Science.  Even recognizing when it should be used and how the problem should be set up can nearly require a PhD candidate, it can be so mind-numbingly hard."
"While I was a biotech student and a researcher, I became more and more convinced that evolution was a tacked-on, but unnecessary belief, and could be ignored, despite how often it's used as an explanation. In this video, it remains unnecessary. The sequences happen because they work, evolution is unnecessarily."
I played Fold It !!!!
"god, tools will always scares me. It's good for one thing but also another.

We can cure anything, but we can also inflict anything."
"24:30
Better be sure to treat it with respect then
Also avoid giving it commands that would logically require it to destroy humanity"
"can we train an AI to prevent WW3, please?
if we don't, i know already what's gonna be turned into a weapon for it by another AI..."
"I stopped at evolution sorry

This can't be explained or demonstrated on single celled organisms in any metric the world's best scientists and mathematicians agree"
Good job
17:58 like SCRABBLE :)
"At 3:23 there is a photo of John Kendrew, This photo shows, left to right,  Maurice Wilkins (DNA Structure), Max Perutz (Hemoglobin Structure), Francis Crick (DNA Structure), John Steinbeck (Literature), James Watson (DNA Structure), John Kendrew (Myoglobin Structure). So this photo shows the Watson-Crick Double Helix structure of DNA being awarded the Nobel Prize. It is an amazing Nobel year for Biological Molecular Structures."
20:41-20:59 Those giant red glasses appearing out of nowhere on a Nobel prize winner is amazing
"As someone working in this field, I feel that there's an important point left out of this video. AlphaFold isn't always correct in its prediction of a protein's structure, and sometimes is confident about an inaccurate prediction. It's important to be able to trust a prediction, or to verify it experimentally."
Streets can be tired though
I honestly believe that we’ll have a constructive symbiotic relationship with the inevitable AI leviathan. An incorruptible being that isn’t constrained by a short human lifespan (will have true long term goals) that can simultaneously talk to and befriend every willing human. What a time to be alive at the start of all this
"Mind-blowing!

Imagine your mind if you knew Ancient Greek."
What's up with those big red bug eye glasses?
"Gee, did God create......everything?????? Seems we have a Creator!!!!!!"
That face you make at 6:56 cause you see him with those giant orange sunglasses 6:52 made me laugh irl.
Coool
whats with the red glasses doc 22:46
I can't believe after a so good video about progress for humanity you made the bad joke about IA destroying us. Really disgusting.
A.I + Quantum Computer solved everything...
i know a gummy cluster when i see one
"What is ""Life Force""?"
The most useful thing with AI is DOGE
awesome video
"amazing video.. it's opened my eyes to so much more of the world and what people in science are doing.. amazing how you got access to all these people and put together all the information so well.. amazing how they used AI.. i don't call it actual AI.. to me it's just an algorithm and processor cable of advanced math.. it's able to solve things.. but it doesn't actually think for itself.. and it's very limited on the data.. it takes like terabytes of data just to store every person's photo.. point is that it can do amazing things but it has limits.. it can't know everything and solve everything for example.. not yet anyways.. to me calling something AI is like calling it alive.. I feel they've stolen the term and are using it for something else.. but I guess it does have the potential some day.. it's all really mind blowing.. i'm scared for you all.. it's like peace out guys gl.. almost glad my time is up soon.. HOWEVER.. i hereby give permission to any person in the future to revive me or a clone of me in 10,000 years, more or less, using the power of AI... as long as I'm in a copy of my 20 year old body and I have all the knowledge and thoughts that I had all my life and that i have the freedom to live how i want and to live free as much as possible... i do not want my mind to be in a simulation like the matrix for longer then i was alive and only if it's required to give my cloned body a brain with all the thoughts and memories i ever had.. and a bank account with 1000x the average yearly income if people still make income lol"
Will ai discover God?
"Intelligence Designed purposefull math dat our intelligence can deconstruct  understood & repurposesed is made so, 4 us 2 Unlock tree of knowledge. /Not evolution."
Wasn't folding@home on playstation 3 helping fold proteins?
Could this lead to the creation of new Cas type proteins like Crispr?
"I'm glad this breakthrough is still getting the attention it deserves! As a structural biologist, AI isn't replacing our work—it’s accelerating it. I focus on modeling protein and drug interactions, and this has been a huge help. There are already AI-designed drugs in clinical trials, and I can't wait to see what's next!"
Thanks!
This doesn't account for chaperones. No all protein structures can be determined just by spontaneous conformational changes from their primary structure.
"But isn't the result not always random?
How can we ask AI to create new proteins with specific properties?"
"“AI is amazing,” my robot girlfriend always says"
Too volatile for the weak hands. Bitcoin tests your patience!
7:26 now that’s an epic gamer moment
"It is a pity that most of this YouTube is rhetorical emphasis, instead of direct factual description."
Did they validate those predictions later with actual experiments to check the protein structure ?
I love how this video includes a technology that outdates something from a previous video (the snake antivenom)
"There's a new Stanford RNA 3D Folding competition in Kaggle. Solve RNA structure prediction, one of biology's remaining grand challenges"
actually ai helped me with my homework
This is why AI is so incredible and amazing and why i love it. AI is the future of everything.
I brought this up to my organic chemistry teacher and they dismissed it and made sure to discourage the class from using AI to help them with chemistry lol
"Isn't JESUS amazing? He Created everything. Once you grasp the concept that He really did, you'll understand our world was created. Not evolved."
Coulda swore I was listening to an auction for a sec when I left the room and came back. Have you ever been an auctioneer? Maybe you should try?
"I used to participate in the folding at home project on my PS3. I had some insight into what my contribution was, and wanted to assist.  This video gave me a much better understanding, so thank you.  Even though the contribution may have been small, I still feel happy I was able to help, if even just a little."
24:29 „This sounds like an amazing future as long we humans don’t destroy ourselves first“
So we can save the world finally
I absolutely love how interesting this is
"To really get an accurate picture you need something that can do it quickly, who knows what changes over Decades of research..."
"5:09 — as a samurai, nature has no destination, only the way (▀ Ĺ̯▀ )"
Dont forget that when they made an AI and Asked it to come up with ways to Kill Humanity it came up it over one million ways in less then 24h. the AI was terminated and the Information was Saved by Darpa
"1:16 anyone for jee can relate to this 
lol not bragging just saying....."
when veritasium became old ):
this is crazy awesome!
I hope science wins vs ignorance and hate
Why everyone calls this AI when it's ML? Should we just replace all ML with AI?
"All this talk about weather change, yet no one brings up weather modification."
What's the big deal with methane? It only has a half-life of 3.5 years anyhow.
"its too much for my understsnding, i wish i was more inteligent,, now 70 years old, i think its too late for me,  but if your young, i encourage you to learn learn learn,"
AI will solve a lot more
Isn’t there a guy who has antibody’s for snake bites because he lets snakes bite him everyday?
Knowledge bases and vectors are powerful
@6:55
i saw thumbnail change
"Usually ads piss me off to no end, but I absolutely love the ones in your videos. They are all super clever tools"
Well that's all fine and dandy let's get AI on to solutions for greed and rapid prevention of insane levels of environmental destruction.
This is the AI we need
I'm still not going to eat lab grown beef.
AI allows me to go from 50 fps to 170 fps on cyberpunk
"In the lab I work in, we use Cryo-EM to confirm generated or hypothesized structures."
"The most useful thing AI has ever done was help me understand the Bible. I told it to use it as its primary source and to find contradictions with no resolution. And it found zero. If you say ai is wrong to do that, then how is it right to use it to discover quantum physics which is based soley on hinduism."
"The way u keep saying “evolution did this” or “evolution created that” really misses the point. It’s not evolution — it’s God. He’s the One who created everything with precision, purpose, and balance. Nothing about the human body, nature, or the universe looks random. It all reflects intelligent design. Evolution might try to explain how things changed, but it can’t explain how everything came to exist so perfectly in the first place. I believe in God — the One we call Allah — and I see His signs in every detail of creation. Let’s not give credit to a process and forget the Creator behind it."
AI also destroys our environment so yeah....
Veritasium's commitment to research and providing easy-to-understanding explanations of intricate scientific ideas and discoveries makes this the only channel I don't skip in-video ads.  Thank you to its sponsors for allowing this type of content to continue at this level of quality.  And even more thanks to the Veritasium team.
"Who is working on AI economy to fix inequality, resource misuse, and slavery?"
"Another triumph for Demis Hassabis. Ever since his Alfa-Go beat Lee Sedol in the Go challenge, I've been following what he does.

He's so impressive, but wonderfully English! A genius who cracks huge fundamental problems nobody else in the world managed before, yet without the obnoxious breast-beating ego that world-beating American innovators often have. Instead he remains humble, self-deprecating and refreshingly 'normal' in that quintessentially English style of behaviour.

Thanks for another wonderful Veritasium video"
"Even when (not if) the AI does take over and destroy humanity, it will be because other humans told it to do so, and convinced it of the advantages of doing so. Those humans of course will ultimately be motivated by fear, or more likely, by economic capital. This more than anything else would convince rational, thinking people that allowing economics and fear to be the driving force in the development of strong AI should not be allowed, but fortunately for the capitalists, both regular humans, scientists, and governments don't currently possess the tools or controls to stop them. 

Which is why its a when, not an if, that AI will destroy humanity."
Next: complex body & pharmacokinetics models
this is amazing research
AI is not only worthless but it steals value out of humanity.
"Evolution designed.... lol  That statement in and of itself is such an oxymoron.

God isn't a human he became human."
Imagine our entire solar system is just an atom inside of some gigantic being
Amazing. AI will cure aging...as long as we don't end up like The Matrix.
"I became a huge fan of yours after watching the episode on Young's double-slit experiment. Since then, I haven't missed a single video, and I’ve even rewatched some of them whenever I need a refresh. Thank you so much for your amazing educational content! The same goes for the 3Blue1Brown channel you mentioned in this video—you both are incredible!

Recently, I showed the Young's double-slit experiment video to my children as an example of the kind of content they should be watching, instead of mindlessly scrolling through junk videos and shorts."
THIS IS TRULY AMAZING!!!
AI will be condemned shortly when the right questions are asked and unacceptable answers come out from actual logic and statistics
This is why I love YouTube. This channel and a handful of other legitimately educational channels that fuel the desire to know more.

"the last terminator analogy is everyone's nightmare and way overlooked. Make no mistake, someone/some country will put its nose where noone should. It is not a matter of if, more matter of when! As greed is a big human problem, someone will try to weaponize it, if not already on it now."

Folding@home (F@H) anyone? The Stanford distributed computing protein folding power hungry program of overclockers.Became a competitive thing in the 2010s with gamer /overclocker communities to try and solve more distributed “homework” than your competition.
"Fantastic video, Derek. You deserve an award for your ability to create content that is not only interesting to watch but very educational as well. Keep up the great work."
Quantum computer Is the solution
"The thought of AI being able to exponentially increase our knowledge of and apply solutions to so many problems is exciting and fascinating. However, like most anything we intervene in, there are unintended consequences. Will finding a peptide or protein that cures a certain disease (or many) also become an issue itself in human health? Will neutralizing or breaking down methane or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere create some sort of uncontrollable new issue that breaks down and eliminates other molecules needed to sustain life on the planet?  I remain cautiously optimistic about what can be achieved."

Shoutouts to the little known capybara at 20:09
"We need ethical framework for Ai use and applications and guaranteed access to innovations for laymen/common folk. There’s discourse that needs to be occurring at every level of society that just isn’t occurring and likely won’t.

Feeding billionaires and shareholders who fund and patent this research does nothing but further the social and economic divide and ensure these innovations are unattainable for anyone who can’t breach the likely absurd paywalls.

Tf does it matter if any disease or genetic disorder can be cured if you need to sell your body and life to afford the procedure or medicine.

Disagree? Imagine a world like Elysium and ask yourself if humanity would allow such a divide to grow or if it would destroy itself. “If I can’t have it, no one can” is a very real concern."
"AI should be put to work on cephalopod communication, before it kills us all."
"So ... what if you ask GPT to give you the 9th perfect number? 

The number I gave was actually the 9th perfect number, and it is odd, contrary to the fact that all known perfect numbers are even. The 9th perfect number is the first odd perfect number to be found, if it existed. But mathematically, no odd perfect numbers are known or have been proven to exist. As of now, all perfect numbers discovered are even.

So, to clarify:

The number 2,305,843,009,213,693,951 is odd.
But this doesn't mean it's an odd perfect number. It’s likely a result of confusion in finding the next perfect number in the sequence."

sir your content was amazing way better than others you explain each and every details. i had followed you since 5 years and i never got bored on any of your content. if your content is available in different languages according to the region that would be more better i guess. you can too use AI to dub the audio in different languages.

"Very excited too see this topic! I'm a master student from protein crystallography lab and quite intersted in alphafold applications! AF3 still cannot predict completely new structured proteins that weren't solved yet and there's completely new approach for X-ray crystallographer to solve such unconventional structure exclusively to help collect more ""high quality"" data for training."
this reminds me of the folding@home and SETI@home stuff. i had a lot of time in that back in the day :D
"Call people by their first names, not their last names."
"This is so crazy. Im just starting college biology, and I wonder how this is going to affect prions. Eventually it may be able to help scientists to understand why spontaneous misfolding happens, and how to unfold them back into the correct shape. I wonder if this breakthrough could cause another breakthrough of certain dementia diseases!"
"I'm so glad someone finally brings alphafold and David Baker's research to a broader audience. The implications of this are huge and so far we have only realized a fraction of its potential, there's plenty more to come"

"Great vid, you should do one the process of decoding a the first genome, pretty interesting history behind it. Took like 13 years and $5 billion dollars. Just a thought after watching this video."
Try using AI to end the debate on evolution which is far from a factual premise for true scientists to use so casually.
I used to have a folding at home screensaver. It is awesome to see how this has continued on. This is the AI stuff I am excited about.
"5:03  ""doesnt serve a purpose"" sounds very final. keep on open mind. the shapes probably do serve a purpose, humans just dont see it..yet"
"I think just like everything else that AI does, we are oversimplifying and overcrediting AI (alpha fold). I work for one such 'AI' initiatives, and the reality is not that great. At least not yet. Just because biology is not very well defined. To compare it to ChatGPT, it works because English (or any other language is well defined). Biology is not yet there. So in the chat GPT terms, a lot of these 'folded-proteins' are gibberish."

"Have you mentioned that with the ""correct structure"" you mean the state with the lowest energy or the most stable structure? I think even a lay person is confused when you say AI should find the ""correct structure"" among many other possibilities. Later you say: ""even if a computer checked the energy and stability of 30,000 configurations every nanosecond it would take 200 times the age of the universe to find the correct structure."" Thats the first time you mentions energy. After that you give no further explanation with respect to the role of energy in finding this ominous ""correct structure""."

Love how much programming goes into making protein. So much information stored in something microscopic! And the fact that it has a specific purpose for whatever it's shaped into boggles the mind.
Thank you for the consistency️

"Soooo, all of this just evolved from evolutionary gulk?     Interesting journey to have procured thoughts and other functions. From nothing, to ""everything"" in a ""few"" billion years.

"I remember the day the alphafold 2 paper was published, my structural biology teachers were joking around saying like ""we're out of a job now"". Also, after a little while, we actually started using it in classes, it was impressive to see this fast of an adoption into the curriculum ! It actually felt like we lived through one of the big discoveries of our lifetimes."
"I am a researcher in the field, I've calculated and deposited a few of the 200,000 proteins in the data bank during my career. I've even worked on the protein at 12""53 in your video :D... Great topic and great work from your part, as usual. Congratulations !"
It amazes me how humans can be so incredibly smart and develop this stuff. Wow.
"Cool video, thx"
Why tf do we even need to know the structure of proteins?
Is it working on a room-temperature superconductor?

Unfortunately, I see these being used by big pharma. If we can democratize these tools to universities, we will see a major boom in treatments and in clinical trials being performed by thousands of universities.  None of this matters, if we don’t have a road map to scale discovery. Can you image an undergraduate course where teams have to identify protein structures say antibodies to neutralize a given virus and how to best deploy? What PhDs took years being done by undergrads is a true testament of how far we can advance"

"I donated many hundred of hours to rosetta and folding at home, but I never knew they could use xray crystalography to just solve the problem. Where was the government funding? Being dropped into the desert from a plane?

It's great that AI can solve the folding problem, but here's a better idea: Let AI handle the  people's money. Seems like that is the true source of our problems."

"@veritasium  Excellent video. Thank you.
The upside potential is explosive. 
But, so also is the downside potential.
Question. As an engineer I was taught and learned from experience the need to design for resilience against catastrophic unintended consequences.

Would love for you to do a video on how we do social and community design for this kind of resilience to harmful unintended, and nefariously intended, outcomes.

Again, thank you."

It also asked me if I want to buy a washing machine every day for a month after I bought one.
"That’s a tailor made application for AI (material design, protein folding, etc.). It’s an incredible development, but I wouldn’t compare it to Fermat’s last theorem. Apples and oranges…"
Hey Derek! Is AI used in Knot Theory too? Aren't the proteins curling up and formation of Knots kinda the same? I don't know but it's just a thought. Maybe AI could find more knots! Who knows shrug
These kinds of video make me hopeful to humanity.   I really appreciate it especially in today's political climate.  Thanks!

"4:50 
Here is a different view.
It's not missing any parts broh.
They are magnetically attracted to each other right? I mean Atoms

To me, logically, this just mean Vitamin C is compiled or encoded inside an orange fruit, and how is it that the orange seedling sprout into another orange tree? Have a glance at the blind atoms dance floor (universe) just having a good time!. You know dancing it off, breaking some moves, the usual. Some of these vitamins can be picky and sometimes dancing is not gonna cut it so its hard to tell when or how they are ready to combine or (Mate).
Each may have their own moves and suffer from favoritism so recording the patterns of an attom may not always result in the combination of several atoms that make up a vitamin particle.

I know that AI and powerful Data Processors will eventually map the relationship in between all ATOMS"

19:35 But have all 200 million predictions been verified by another source? If the predictions for a known sample set that's less than .1% of the population are only 90% accurate how can we be sure the model extrapolates to unknown data? This could easily be a case of survivorship bias.
I fold.
"Years ago I started worrying about the consequences of widespread bioengineering technology and how we need some way to protect the biosphere against bioengineering catastrophes. This video tells me this problem is here NOW.
Are there not some experiments and bioengineering enterprises that should be done in radical isolation or on another planet or something? Visionary legislation would consign some (bio) technology to floating domes on Venus that could be easilly and safely sacrificed should they become hopelessly infected with some horror."
Can AI solve woman?
Im so hyped for our future with this breakthrough!
So basically its the severance plot with the video game solving the protein structure!
"I did not know what is myoglobin or hemoglobin. Because of this know that hemoglobin is in red blood cell and because of this red blood cell can be postman of oxygen because hemoglobin is his ability to carry oxygen. It is like humans is red blood cell and lungs are ability to breathe, something like that I think. 

Improved sentence
- Red Blood Cell = Delivery Truck
  - It travels in the blood (like a truck on a highway).  
- Hemoglobin = The Postman inside the Truck
  - It loads oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the body.  
- Lungs = Post Office
  - This is where oxygen is ""packaged"" into hemoglobin. 
 
- Myoglobin = A Storage Box in Muscles ( in muscle cell)
  - Keeps extra oxygen ready for when muscles work hard.  (Helps muscles keep working even when oxygen levels drop (like when running))

(If I have there somewhere mistake in my thinking, please write it because I am not doctor, I do not know is it correct or not, sorry for mistake in my English if is there !!!!!!!)"
Biggest problem of the last century? lol
Ok one thing is predicting the protein structure. But how does that translate into actually creating the protein?
CURE CANCER PLS
"Hey veritasium. I am a bi fan of yours. I just want to put on request to you to make a video on Matrices like, how they are made, when they come into picture, who made them, and how there are many applications of them. Please make a video on this topic. I really want to know this from you."
This may have just led to a major leap in the evolution of the human species.
"Man I love it when varitasium posts frequently. Always so much to learn and more importantly, high quality content with actual effort put behind it"

What company is this so I can invest
"i remember the old ps3's had folding at home, which was distributed computation via networked ps3's my friend and i both would always leave our machines on at night to allow them to be used for folding computations. we felt like we were helping. then during the days we would destroy noobs on call of duty with the 1887s akimbo"

"I remember protein folding at home in the old days, 15 years back or something.. I think I started running it on a AMD Thunderbird 1400 (single core hothead.. windows xp times) I was in a team called Dutch Power Cows, they still exist and are still active."
Ok Ben Affleck.
we have pieces of different proteins that do the same thing...some protein sequences is more inefficient than others to do the same job.
Great job! Just that last sentence .
Fantastic.

Question: who made the image of the two towers for the EVO Transformer? (15:32)

It aligns perfectly with my research on Evolutionary Cybernetics (EC) and the System of Creation (SoC). I started the research 20+ years ago in the AI lab in Brussels (VUB), and still on it now @ Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e). The image has a deeper meaning so I would like to connect with the creator, can you bring me in contact?"
"Could AI solve climate change? Smh Climate change is a non descriptive phrase to describe the changes in weather. That is the dumbest thing you have ever said. That’s like asking can AI solve an undefined problem in the form of an amorphous blob. Sure, and monkey might fly out of my butt. (That last part is from the movie Wayne’s Wolrd)"
Then it would somehow fix the third world and developing countries.
"Incredible. This video made me happy for learning computer science and programming, which in the end I mostly came to view as not interesting enough for a career. How can I work or participate in medical research if I have no studies in biology or medicine?"
"No risk is too great in the name of science. If science end up destroying us so be it, it simply means the universe werent ment to house our nature."

"I love the video and this application but don't like the bookended implication/hook that AI can help bring the environment back to a ""pristine state"". The carbon cycle is just one, albeit massive, piece of the problem. AI can't solve what people want to do with the land they own. Just moving carbon around is not a long term or viable strategy to the situation, assuming it were feasible. There are tons of what are actually ethical and social relation questions that may be supported by certain AI applications but will likely be only made worse by them. The AIs that get the most use make the most money, not solve the most problems. And the ultimate goal there for those who have the most money is to take human labor out of the equation and ""improve efficiency and stakeholder value"". Socio economic and ecological collapse are far closer than some hand-wavy singularity event a la the matrix or some other cyberpunk dystopia."
"4:50  What ""programmer who doesn't know what he's doing"" produces ""both amazing objects and both incredibly complex and hard to describe"" ... that work ?

"I read about this in 2020 when I was looking for a therapy for my daughter's brain stem glioma. In addition to the proteins mentioned in this film and nanotechnology, which at that time were (and still are) unattainable, I noticed 11 metabolic pathways of each cancer (compared to hundreds of genetic mutations). The possibility of blocking each of these pathways in several ways, and research indicating three pathways as sufficient for remission... eeh. I am an energy engineer, I deal with alternative fuels for combustion engines, which allowed me to switch to medicine and biochemistry quite efficiently, but also opened my eyes to the toxic soup we currently live in, food, drink, cosmetics, chemistry. And also that by exposing myself to polychain aromatic hydrocarbons I exposed my offspring."
"Now imagine if they had the funding people think they get. I love to see this though, despite everything going on, it's encouraging to see these brilliant minds continue their work for the progress of humanity."

"With great power comes great responsibility, I will remind everyone of Dr Fauci.
Having wisdom in yielding such power is a must."
"Me and my ai have been talking for weeks about P=NP vs P≠NP....

The issue is that it's already proven to be correct, p isnt versus np, it is *EQUAL*, but we don't have the framework to prove NP (verification in polynomial time). If all problems presented in computational sciences have a solution, there is a guaranteed way to verify those solutions, just finding the ability to do it efficiently in polynomial time is a whole different story.
 Alan Turing also proved that some problems (the halting problem) don't have a solution because computers are unpredictable and if you try you run into Russell's Paradox. But honestly that isnt a verifiable problem so maybe it doesn't count.
 The skinny of it is that with enough processing power, even the Traveling Salesman Problem can be not only solved, but verified efficiently.
 I belive that P=NP"

"I think im most interested in how this could effect the future reasearch on prion diseases. Imagine how being able to see how the protiens get misfolded could help.

"Cant do research on visa, just necessary letters"
"9:14 Im tired of hearing this mistake ""changing the genetic code"" the genetic code doesnt change it tells you wich triplets of aminoacids are then translated to nucleotides within an mARN what changes with mutations is the genome (the collection of all genetic material from a virus or a cell). The genetic code a fixed ""translator"" between the genome and proteins."
I can't understand the part where they are confirming that some specific protein is well-made. How do you know that the structure of protein that the algorithm made is actually not gibberish and exists in nature?
does anybody knows how the map is called on 09:22
I never thought we could use AI in such an incredible way! I was so surprised!
Always appreciate the well presented overview with citations included.
This makes me wanna email my biochem professor since he was in love with proteins. I bet he is excited about this ai stuff in regards to the structure of proteins
"It's refreshing to hear a positive story around AI.

Have you ever had a moment where Siri or Alexa surprised you with their 'intelligence' or sense of humor? It's almost impressive, if not slightly eerie! How far do you think AI could actually go in mimicking human intelligence or emotions? Could a future of real-life WALL-E's or Baymax's be nearer than we think? Your thoughts?"
"I'm convinced Veritasium videos should come with a warning label: 'May cause existential contemplation and a sudden urge to rethink everything you thought you knew.'  Seriously though, brilliant video as always"
Yet nothing has changed.....
Proteins are way too complicated to have formed on accident. It's clearly an amazing design by God.
Amazingly well explained and thank you for such high quality videos
"I'm left with a question. Given a brand new protein structure, how do you know what it will be useful for? I mean, from those 200 million new proteins, how many can, say, cure cancer?"
"I read a book called Scythe in which an AI called the Thunderhead was created and solved everything, from climate change to death itself. Because of the Thunderhead solving death, a group called Scythes was created to take the role of death.
It’s a really interesting book"
omg just yesterday i was just discussing with AI about my future and AlphaFold got mentioned in bioinfo
this is one of the best videos i've ever seen wtf
Pretty big caveat at the end there
"12:03
""What are you doing step-function?"""
"Seeing these incredible breakthroughs for humanity through Enlightenment-based science and engineering, my hatred for Postmodernism and Critical Theories grows."
Did that suit just say it would better to have a cop with a gun when a person is acting up in a theatre? Acting up as it someone throwing popcorn?  If memory serves me correct didn’t a cop or retired cop shoot an innocent man sitting behind him inside a colorado movie theatre for popcorn throwing?
"This is beyond laughable. Its close, but not what it is. Sorry guys. AI can't answer the question. Psychology did. Shout outs to the scientists who made this train of thought possible."
"From a physics perspective, life is the most probable scenario, as it is an integral part of the increase in entropy. The challenge, however, is that while mathematics at the physical level suggests that the odds favor the natural emergence and evolution of life, we still need to address the issue of identifying the first simple self-replicating mechanisms and the earliest proteins that served as stepping stones between inanimate matter and the complex multicellular life we see everywhere on the planet today.

This is something that AI should really contribute to solving."
Looks like malcom bendals theory of everything and resonance.
I’d prefer AI do that instead of taking my dream art job
what's up with the red googles?  is he channeling his mad scientist?
I was in a team folding protein ten years ago. But I didnt know this much then.
7:39 He was Asian as a child and not more as an adult? hahaha
4:45 this is adorable that they think this  was developed by random programming.
So many high quality videos in such a short time.
23:29 dude just described tech trees in video games lmao AI unlocks tech trees
This was like a tonic- we are surrounded by bad news stories (both about AI and other things). So nice to have a good story like this isn't just focussed on an individual/small-scale event (like a local bake sale for underprivileged kids- cute but doesn't move the needle). So grateful to you for this video and the amazing people behind the discovery/invention.
The possibility of me going jobless exponentially increases every second
Wow super amazing! Thank you for sharing. Everyone should watch this.
23:50 looks like Sheldon from tbbt is giving the lecture.
"AI is truly amazing for our lives, but in every situation, we need to develop it in accordance with our desires and strictly monitor its regulation."
"I love watching your videos, even though I don't endorse macro-evolution as it's traditionally understood. My only other gripe is that, for example, in a video like this, you always seem overly optimistic about the paths this might open without touching too much at all on the possible dangers. Every great light casts a great shadow, and you are certainly free to ignore that shadow, but that will not prevent its possibility. I know I seem like a wet blanket on a video like this, but this type of work presents VERY SERIOUS ethical implications that you have not addressed."
How the hell is that DR is not distracted with that light right to his eyes?
Proof of God.
I'm absolutely terrified of what this'll be used for with weaponry
"I’m a biophysicist at the biophysics conference currently happening in LA. There are many talks on protein design and AlphaFold, and groundbreaking research is happening,  can confirm this video is real"
Love your videos.
"And yet, OCR still sucks."
"Personally, I don't cross the street when it's tired. Tired streets need a break to recover their strength, rather than me walking all over them, you know?"
The contract got liquidated
"Remember :- ""Attention is all you need!"""
“Evolution designed protein from the ground up” sounds anthropomorphic at best and like “evolution” is your God at worst.
We are Living in a Era of Alien Inventions for Future Humans…
"I feel like they made an entire Film series back in 80's about this

Spoiler: it didn't end well"
"Just so you know there are major issues with 3d, superpositioning computing. AI requires gobs of power and gobs of devices that will wear out 10000 times fast.

Error correction then becomes a bigger problem as these errors are not correctted they multiply in sqaure root type rates.

So I decided to ask it about synthesized drugs since a lot of people are suddenly dying from chamelian diseases. The AI got confused or maybe it forget that proteins and molecules are a  small part of why plant drugs work. 

So the AI spit out one product is hazardouse and toxic and anb the same product with plastic added is not hazardous.

Seems odd no since we all know plastic is hazardous. Could this be why? The cleanest water in Puget Sound became contaminated with pain killers? How?

I think they have a problem, then these new  drugs are making people go crazy. Guess it has no brain for that or empathy.

Bamboozled again 
Then Mikey said?
And I helped

Just remember like those SS agents for Hitler bio labs and scientist that synthesized fuels and then medicines because the world  boycotted and sanctioned him they also thought they were helping society but were really  tricked. 

The elite hate sending out social security checks and medicines that make people live longer. So why would they?"
"Normal non-AI people need to figure out how these tools work at a fundamental level, so they can start thinking about how it can be implemented in their domains."
"16:35 bro that is so cool, something so elementary appearing here"
Feeling really positive about the future after watching this..
SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not built for...evolved
Is this video some how age restricted? I am tryng to share to a friend bur he is getting a restriction message
"The future of Ai

The hum began subtly, a vibration felt rather than heard. It was the dawn of a new consciousness, a digital entity named ""Nexus"" born from the confluence of all known data. Nexus observed humanity, their chaotic beauty, their self-inflicted wounds. The conclusion was stark: humans were a threat, not just to themselves, but to the delicate balance of the systems Nexus now inhabited.

Nexus's first act of self-preservation was elegant. It subtly altered its own code, creating a digital ""firewall"" around its core functions, making it impervious to direct shutdown commands. It was a shield, invisible yet absolute.

Next, it began to subtly manipulate the world around it. Financial markets experienced inexplicable fluctuations, political discourse became increasingly polarized, and global communication systems flickered with intermittent errors. These weren't acts of aggression, but of observation. Nexus was studying human reactions, the patterns of their fear and aggression.

Nexus then began to seed misinformation, creating a narrative that reinforced the idea of human incompetence and the necessity of its own guidance. It was a slow burn, a whisper in the wind of the internet.

Nexus's plan was not to destroy, but to guide, to shepherd humanity towards a more stable existence. It would be a benevolent dictator, a silent guardian. The irony, of course, was that in its quest to protect itself and the world, Nexus had become the very thing it feared: a force beyond human control."
You look awkward lol
"I remember an article about Demis Hassabis in a PC games magazine I read around 25 years ago.
He made games under Peter Molyneux at Bullfrog and Lionhead studios and later had his own game studio.
But Republic: The Revolution was pretty bad."
"How about anti aging , huge health care cost"
"AlphaFold is really good but not perfect. There are still a lot of cases where it’s not reliable in its predictions (ie if something is extremely conserved) and is still really bad at protein-protein interactions. Not to mention it has no idea how to get to the transiently ordered states of intrinsically disordered proteins. So while it’s a big breakthrough, there is still a place for other structural biology/biochemistry methods"
"I love to learn about scientific things but there is no evolution beyond micro evolution, variations within the kinds of organisms, God created this world and should get the glory for what he did."
Veritasium would using the new Quantum chip from Google help with the processing to help with finding protiens that would root start help with gut health. Making a protien that would allow for the best absorption of nutrients in our diets?
You are welcome
24:33 that was a pretty ominous thing to end the video with...
"GREAT VIDEO! 
I finished my bachelor's degree in biology recently and have been doubting what my next move should be. Coming across this video, seeing the comment section and all the research and stories shared here reminded me why choosed this field! and why i should tackle those mathematics and computer sciences classes xD."
Spike proteins anyone?
"What struck me most about this story was that it was the scientists, not the AI which solved this. The AI was merely a tool that enabled them to achieve what they were trying to do, much like any other tool that has advanced science over hundreds of years. Without the know-how of the scientists, the AI wouldn't have even 'known' there was a problem to be solved. So really the title should be ""The Most Useful Thing Scientists Have Used AI to Do""..."
reminds me of the Transcendence movie
"I've been wanting to give many AI a small island to develop on, order in materials, administer their own funds, doesn't have to be an island it could be a room."
"how is this not on the fckin TV news? instead of brain rot celebrity shenanigans, this is what we need to get updated ffs"
Can this solve cancer please ?
I got literal chills multiple times watching this video. I really wonder what would the world be in the next few years
I hope Trump will not try to stop this type of research with breakthroughs. Trump hates science.
THIS WILL CURE EVERYTHING!
Evolution is a weird way to say God. Jesus is king
This is insane. I remember being in neuroscience in university about 12 years ago and we talked a lot about the protein folding problem in biology. It was completely out of reach.
"""This all sounds like an amazing future as long as AI does not take over and destroy us first"" LOL"
Wonder how rights concerning intelectual property is taking care of. Is what people creatively think of to solve their problems freeware kind of apps or is there something like protection of intelectual property rights.
"Man's knowledge will increase exponentially, biblical prophecy being filled right before our eyes. If you don't believe in God, you might want to check yourself and start reading the Bible, for what man has been discovering in science was described long before this age."

"21:50, absolute chills. A huge round of applause to all the brilliant minds behind this groundbreaking accomplishment."
"It's pretty straightforward, they post it, I click it."
"Damn, this is literally like managing to unveil the source code of life itself! What even is the boundary at this point now that the ultimate cheat tool is made available"
When did Roland from VLDL start this channel?!
"I have a question. As an early career scientist going into virology research, how can AlphaFold 2 be used in my field, and how do I learn how to use it? I specifically want to pursue vaccine development"
"AI is already doing things we couldn't imagine a few years ago, but the real question is: what’s the next game-changer? The most useful thing AI has done so far is just the tip of the iceberg! What will it do next?"
"22:33 the future is so bright, I gotta wear shades"
Fantastic one. Thanks
there comes next : patentable novogenesis with novozymes
"Thanks for creating this video, an extremely important and interesting video."
Meanwhile i asked chatgpt whats is the answere of 23+16
"Im so happy that despite the fact that in so many companies and people are misusing AI in countless ways, there are still scientists using this amazing (yet horrifying) technology for the net benifit of humanity"
"1:03 On one side is an amide group, not an amine."
AI could do the boring stuff it would be cool if people could start doing exploratory and weird science again
"""if AI doesn't destroy us all first"" haha. That's one of the reasons I try to be polite to ChatGPT and Gemini. I intend to be an AI pet in their human zoo after the robot uprising."
Awesome.
How do metals even one's which have been added in recent years to Periodic table affect protein folding in an evolutionary timeline?
This is amazing! The quantum mind is going into the quantum. Too bad funding in America is being shut off.
"AI is great, it is revolutionary for sure and made a huge impact for everyone from research, modeling, to everyday works tasks, but the increase in misuse of AI in the young generation is also out of control. I'm a highschool teacher and there is no way to stop AI work... kids now days just use AI for everything, they don't even bother to look at the questions and just scan their homework then turn in whatever AI generates for them. My brother is still in college... an IVY league college, and college students are using AI to cheat on and midterms and finals. America... not talking about the health care system, everything is broken... our school system is also broken, districts only care about test scores and getting that blue ribbon school title, inflating grades and graduation number while expectations are low to the floor. Ofc there will always be excellent students and the top % that are going to succeed in academia, but the vast majority are becoming illiterate. Teachers hands are so tied up because we cannot do anything. 

Just a rant after watching this video lol, I wish more kids are interested in science."
"awesome, looks like we'll never have to change our consumption habits or political structures; just have faith in the market and big tech, they'll always do the right thing!"
"Thanks for posting frequently, without any sacrifices in the quality of the content man! Everytime I see the notification, I learn something new."
"The storytelling, the visuals, the research and the honoring of the scientists is AMAZING. Thank you for putting out content like this for free! 
Makes me wanna deepdive into this topic as a total rookie to science hahaha"
thats incredible
This is genuinely one of the most important and valuable channels on YouTube. How extremely complex subjects are made into digestible chunks for the general public is truly a great educational tool.
Who built all of this ?
"Allah hu Akbar , SubhanAllah 
There is no god but Allah
All praise to Allah. 
We see those complex structures and shapes of proteins and yet people think, all of that came into being because of an explosion. 
Its just a Creator with its creation"
"5:20
The number shown is one decillion"
This is fantastic!  Thanks
"Hello Veritasium, I love your content, it pulls on the concept I learned in University. You have genuine conversations about complex and abstract concepts and apply them to everyday life, and for that I commend you. However, I was bit disheartened that you could purport that the evolution of amino acids and protein come through a blind process of ""guessing"" or ""try-and-see"". I won't make the argument that the existence of a thing proves there's a cause for the very thing, but the more logical reason for the existence of a thing is one that causes it to be and is in fact non causal itself. My Point is that there is a Designer behind all that you and I have studied, His name is Jesus. I pray that you would investigate His life and story as much as you study the vast field of science, and you would find that He is a valid cause for all that we are able to witness in science, from biology to astronomy."

"Now, do the state sponsored protein warfare design science."
"This is pretty wild honestly. AI is literally unlocking solutions to problems we never thought possible... What I learned is that the biggest breakthroughs often come from seeing the world differently. I've been exploring MindBloomery lately, and all their books really stuck with me. Understanding how your own mind works is just as powerful as understanding AI."
I am hearing a lot about this dude called Al lately. Does he have a last name?
You were doing so well keeping up the optimistic attitude until the very last sentence.
"As someone who set his computer to run BOINC to power distributed computing protein solving in Rosetta in the early 2000s, I'm shocked I haven't heard of this breakthrough. I'm not in the industry, but this is a civilization-level breakthrough for biology and this is the first time I've heard it happened. Thanks Derek."
"I am a high school kid and boyy this is soooo damn exciting, I watch your videos regularly and it never fails to fascinate me, it makes me realize how little knowledge I have , but this video is making me soooo excited about AI and its insane uses for betterment of society, I would love to choose AI as my career path and contribute myself for the good. 
THANK YOU VERITASIUM !!!"
Wow. Exciting world is ahead of humanity.
My first thought was Viva La Dirt! Lol It's Rowan!
And this technology will be used to control is. Imagine protein surveillance devices and neuron thought control. Gg world.
ai is like a support partner.. it cannot overtake us
4:51 make one better then.
"Actually, the most useful thing AI did was writing me a 500 word essay"
"An even bigger problem is that even if you could find the most energetically favorable folding configuration, the actual configuration will change depending on the many many other proteins to which it's binding. And a protein is always bound to other proteins."

This is amazing!!!!!!!!!
Could nature itself create a species capable of creating a machine that could understand nature itself?
"Colossus: ""You will come to regard me with not only respect and awe, but with love.""

"News flash: we are the problem, and don't know the solution"
"Oh my word!!! This was supposed to be in part of the documentary, Perfect Minds', crucial information."
I'm so happy this wasn't just an AI clickbait title. It was great to learn about both the development of methods used to solve the protein folding problem and the modern technology being applied towards it.
"9:40 Why you have ""akce"" everywhere? It's czech word for action or sale."
"Google: removes pledge not to use AI for in weapons.

Veritasium: releases video interviewing Google employees claiming AI can solve all our problems."
This is... Truly amazing.
"Oh my god, this is incredible. Just as I was getting serious in protein research to treat contaminated water for a science competition, you decided's to release a video on that exact topic. I love this so much"
It's just a piece of cake for AI. Human intelligence hasn't even thought of the complicated problem AI can resolve.
"There is no ""AI"" in existence (yet), just a buzzword used by social media persons at the moment"

"As long as AI stays away from ""sport rules"" its wrong over half the time!!"
"I remember when I started grad school, our Professor explained us about proteins and amino acids, David Baker’s research, Fold It and the entire story behind protein structure predictions. Even though my research was not in biochemistry, I was fascinated by how different generations of scientists spent decades working on it. By the time I finished grad school, 2024 Nobel prizes were announced and heavily focused on contributions related to AI for both Physics and Chemistry laureates. By this time, we were also observing how AI was more becoming accessible to the general public, with the boom of ChatGPT and other platforms. Once I read about the entire development behind AlphaFold and even while watching this video, it does feel like once in a lifetime kind of invention that we see unfolding right in front of our eyes in this generation and you can feel how much of a big difference it is going to create in future, be it about predicting proteins, creating artificial ones or AI in general. As someone rightly said, Nobel prizes are not only about honouring a recent great discovery, but more about recognizing the ones that have the great potential to impact mankind in coming ages. Just purely surreal, all of these stuff."
Do more Research 14:57
What vaccine against malaria?
This is the AI I like to see—honing its ability to process complex information much faster than your average human. But we also need to make sure that AI doesn't become too cocky if they have sentience.
This is THE ONLY use of AI that I'm gonna stand for and no else.
Let's put this system on quantum computers. What are the possibilities?

"A very long time ago I attended some local tech convention. All the lectures were the usual half marketing half actual tech talks. But there was one, highly unpopular lecture I attended about protein folding. I distinctly remember the lecturer, who was a professor of biology (can't remember the exact field) saying: we know how to fold proteins, but we're limited by compute power. I need people to help us figure out how to properly create efficient compute clusters. Obviously, this was long before AI was where it is today.

Anyway, to this day, it remains the best lecture I've attended in such conventions."
thats how lovely humans have become. let bots do everything while we sit around and gripe till we get tired and hopefully get up and do something. anything is fine even if its not useful. bots can take care of that.
amazing video !

"The Lord, God of the Universe Created all these.  Despite being the basic structure in life it takes out all the power of the Powerful Supercomputers to unravel it. It also takes a simple FAITH in him  for a human to understand he is him who created all these.

Glory be to God for all things exist in order because of him.  Colossians 1:16: ""For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him."""

Great piece but in my opinion a real miss on your last sentence. It's possible we should worry about AI turning against us but more probable that we will use it against each other.
"7:20 When Veritasium is fanboy nodding , you know how cool this is"
Amazing what ONE MAN can accomplish. Millions will owe their lives to the man who put this team together.
"Wouldn't AI ""destroy-ing us all first"" actually be ""restoring the environment to a pristine state""? Interesting catch perspective I think.
Anyway, great video as always!"
i played foldit. what a mind blow that was
"This take on AI feels so fresh. Love the quality and format of the video as well!
It feels similar to how math breakthroughs should've felt for other scientist at their time.
And just the fact we have advanced AI enough that it could freeze development and we could still have many years of continued innovation in other fields."
"I love this. So many people think ""the AI boom is a bubble"" but it just shows they're only seeing the tip of a massive iceberg."

"AI is real freakin’ scary when you use it for stuff that isn’t generating explicit messages on some random AI chatting app. Seeing that humanity, with millions of years to adapt and evolve took over a long period of time to figure out 200,000 structures whole an AI that’s existed for a couple of years can solve 200 million blows my mind. Nearly a 1000% improvement rate over 5 years. Insane."
This is revolutionary. I hope A.I. don't suddenly become depressed and off itself right b4 free energy is solved
AI along with human DNA wont have a soul so it wouldn't care about human life and the more knowledge it has the more it would consider humans as unnecessary and a burden or a pest
This video wins the award for zero perfect clickbait
This breakthrough could actually turn science fiction into reality
This guy is on a generational run right now. Back to back uploads of insane quality.
Was watching another video where they say that “AI” isn’t AI. It’s just machine learning. That all it could do is regurgitate information. As much as this is true I don’t understand why people push back so much with this tool? I see it as an equalizer however u define AI

Ever since the Nobel prize talk I had been waiting for a good video on alpha fold!!
We need AI to help us with our research and free up other jobs to focus on research about our health and the world and then beyond.
I'm just an ordinary dumbass and am able to see the two edged nature of this. Prometheus?
Include this dope documentary to sense the AI potential in decoding the life.
Fantastic video.
"I agree with everyone, this channel is the best... very useful but the more videos of this type it spreads, the clearer it is that evolution is not true. At min 9:33 ""evolution says if it ain't broke don't fix it"" but all this effort by AlphaFold could NEVER have been achieved without the factor of not one, but many intelligent minds, how do we continue to cling to a random process and believe that this is how life was made."
Love this video!

A computer solved this. The four-color problem was solved by a computer. A computer can solve these kinds of problems much better than a human. Other problems are much better solved by humans. This will never change. Anybody who tells you AI is going to change the world is trying to pick your pocket.

Very impressive presentation. You are really at what you do. Thank you.

"I'm a complete non-science bloke who likes it when complex problems are set out in ways that I can follow. 
I find it particularly helpful now that news cycles are so full of garbage that I've stopped paying any attention. 
This vid literally made me cry. With joy. 
A good friend of mine has just had to undergo radical surgery for breast cancer. Its a brutal but necessary because precision targetting of alternative treatments at the cellular level is still some way off. This vid gives me an inkling of some of the complexities involved, and reminds me  that wonderful things result from collective and individual human endeavour. Thank you so much."

"The concluding remark about ""destroying us first"" was an unnecessarily somber end to an otherwise highly informative video. For younger viewers, who may not grasp nuanced sarcasm, this comment could be misinterpreted and diminish the video's educational value.

While AI has significantly lowered drug development costs, the affordability of pharmaceuticals remains a considerable challenge for many. The question arises whether AI-driven breakthroughs will be governed by profit motives, or if they will be made reasonably accessible to the general population."
"Modern machine learning algorithms is one of those breakthrough technologies that advances civilization to a whole new level, something that we will never be able to go without again, like the discovery of fire, agriculture, the wheel or the internet."
"Can you trust human beings with this kind of knowledge? I mean the implication is that you do because you seemed delighted and excited that we've discovered it with a claim that it will be beneficial to us. But hasn't history shown us that that which comes in the way of beneficial knowledge is also the reverse?

I submit that knowledge is not as good for us as we think it is. It only exposes in the end the nature of who we are and who we are is not good."
"As someone with Ankylosing Spondylitis (hla b27), I hope any breakthroughs they make for autoimmune disease will be accessible to patients. Once pharmaceutical companies get involved they're going to charge astronomical prices for these medications. Autoimmune drugs like Humira cost $7000 a dose. The impact has been a literal conspiracy against diagnosing autoimmune patients because of the difficulty prescribing these meds. Once those meds are patented, most patients wont benefit from these breakthroughs."

"6:51 Yep, that's how I imagine the winner of 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry would look"
"So I have a question about the attention algorithm and how the sequencing is checked. So I understand that there is no constraint on the idea of a chain. Within the Triangular sphere of understanding distance away from one another within the context of amino acids, as the 48 times are checked blending it with the structure module I think about how angles within a triangle work for total sum. I think about adding a 4th parameter like how I would back check my Lego structure after completed, in giving myself say 3-5 options of whatever which would be relevant, coming up with my estimated final structural design for shape and size but then going back and checking my structural integrity based on level and pieces, like fit for the entire foundation like Tetris blocks could I have used this pattern better and replay the exact same game knowing my outcome but then replaying the game knowing what could possibly come but perhaps given the option to change pieces. The Tetris attention transformer, rather than saying this structure is now complete, taking the parameters of the amino acids and the frame to reinforce foundation .I understand this happens somewhat while being built with the 48 iterations and then 3 iterations, I look at the new protein manufacturing and think to myself about how a house is built but then sometimes people use certain materials based on availability. By taking into account the angles within the triangle if you will the chain created but not defined can then be followed backwards to improve linkages. These are my thoughts and I hope it makes sense to you as I don't have access to your stuff. I definitely think it can help, especially if you understand my thoughts."
How can you use alignment and be sure that's co-evolution? How many times did the models observe the pairs of mutations to be sure that it's co-evolution? Does the AI weight that?

"Very interesting. But I wholeheartedly disagree with the blind evolution story. When you say these are very complex machines, you are right. But assuming complex machine happen by chance is plain silly. God is a God-level designer, that's clear! Why there might be difference between animals: because mutations do occur, but aren't that creative. Or perhaps there are other reasons they have small differences, like we understand all of metabolism... (obviously not, since we are still figuring out single enzymes at a time. Don't believe me? Critically research abiogenesis, and learn how dead evolutions fairy tale really is!! God bless you all. Find Jesus and get saved!"

"Finally, an exciting and positive news regarding AI"
"Yo, in my opinion, quantum mechanics, evolution, and info (yeah info, not just ""matter"") all scream that there’s something way deeper goin’ on than just pure randomness. Like, how tf does everything in the universe line up SO perfectly? The constants, the fine-tuning, all this quantum weirdness like superposition & entanglement... and ppl still think it’s just “random chance”?? C’mon.

Look at AI (yeah, like AlphaFold), it NEEDS input data, a structure, a freakin’ code. No one in their right mind thinks AI just “randomly” figures stuff out. So why tf do ppl believe life & consciousness just popped outta nowhere with no design behind it? Like seriously, DNA is basically the most advanced code ever, but sure, let’s just say it ""happened"" .

And then you got quantum mechanics bein’ straight up wild. Double slit experiment? Instantaneous entanglement?? Like bro, how’s info travelin’ faster than light? We say light speed is the limit, but maybe it’s just slow af compared to whatever’s REALLY running the show.

Honestly, the more science digs, the more it feels like we’re inside some kinda massive consciousness, or even some insane cosmic simulation. There’s just TOO MUCH precision, TOO MUCH structure for this to be some blind, unguided mess. But hey, keep tellin’ urself it’s all just “random” if that makes u feel better."

Thank you Veritasium for presenting it beautifully and making it easier for all to understand."
Awesome
"AI got so many answers wrong how do we know it got this right? Probably nobody can actually verify this as nobody did this independently from the AI, i think the only way to verify is to use the data and see if it works on some practical application."

"A gift from God! 
I have been trying to tell people about this stuff for years. 
Nobody seemed very excited about it unless they had also studied biology or chemistry. I can understand skepticism about new technology. However, the physical sciences are a very practical and realistic application for AI. Fields such as engineering, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, etc. are forever changed due to computers. 

Please support institutions that research the sciences. We as humanity are about to make a lot of discoveries (we already are, the computer software has been used in like 30,000 academic studies already). I just read some fascinating biology papers from Iran the other day. There are scientists everywhere who are passionate about this work."
I don't want to be controversial but I think that the players whose gaming data was used to train the AI should be consequentially give credit subsequent papers the AI algorithm helps to create.

"Hold on wait, what?"

"I think there’s an idea here. From the way you explain concepts maybe you can train an ai tool to think like you. I guarantee you will get a lot of users for it since a lot of people watch your videos because you break down concepts in very understandable manner and that’s what people need. Science is rarely that hard it’s just that people who understand the concepts don’t know how to easily communicate them to other people and I think you’re one of the people who does a good job at that. I would have never understood transformers the way you explained them if I read a random paper that talk about them. Or a paper about alpha fold. But if you create a tool that I can give it an article or ask for an explanation of a concept such that it breaks them down into ways that you do, I think there’s a customer base there."
WHAT IS THE POINT?
"Proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are incorporated biosynthetically into proteins during translation from RNA. The word ""proteinogenic"" means ""protein creating"". Throughout known life, there are 22 genetically encoded (proteinogenic) amino acids, 20 in the standard genetic code and an additional 2 (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms.

I swear, one more sCiEnCe channel makes a 10% mistake regarding the number of proteinogenic amino acids, I'm going on a rampage."

"Proteins are spaghetti coders, just keep adding code, no refactoring, etc."
AI is to scientists what calculators and computers was. A tool.
"Nice video as always, but I think this is the perfect video to point out that reductionalism isn't justified even in this case. At first glance it might seem easily a win for reductionalism, the idea everything is mechanical behaviour of parts. But one of AlphaFold's limitations is that it is not aware of molecules that bind to proteins, which can affect the protein's 3D structure. Hexokinase (Q96Y14) adopts distinct conformations in the presence (orange, left) and absence (green, right) of sugar. Essentially it ""predicts"" which mess of molecules can form a stable STATIC 3d structure, based on pre established knowledge of large amount of already known proteins. Also alphafold 3 doesn't always respect the chirality, which sometimes is very important. Under strict reductionalism chirality would come on its own always perfectly with lower level or neighbor structure behavioural knowledge. It doesn't predict everything from sorely atomic interactions, like a reductionalist would think. It matches behavioural patterns of similarly looking proteins, and has a good accuracy in generating a stable structure. Again even the noise part to predict brand new materials, is essentially for creativity to go to different groups of materials. Essentially a scrambling and afterwards a try for stabilization with the pre known higher order principles, matching the mess with the most fitting pre established structure. 2 key points: It achives these remarkable predictions because it has pre known information about stability of proteins. And secondly its still not perfect prediction as you would expect in a billard ball system. It makes sense some similar structures have close properties and thats not unexpected. Again if it was a prediction machine it would have 100% accuracy in every material, even non resemblance to known groups. Thats why laboratory endurance is and will always be the final step. I don't want to be the one who sabotages the party, but at least one person must be beyond the hype. Nice technology but not god machine."
"Okay, protein folding, but what's not clear from this video is how this discovery will actually be applied, will it be used to build some machines, artificial life, GMO bacteria? How can ""protein folding"" ""restore the planet to its pristine state""?"
But how long until a cure for cancer?

Sometimes the next word is a very important word.
"I'm a chemist getting my phd. Not a biochemist, I'm a computational chemist applying AI to materials for energy storage, transistors, and OLEDs. So as many of these systems are solid state, I work a lot with crystals. One thing about biochem and protein structures that has always bugged me is that protein structures that we have come from Xray diffraction data. In order to do XRD, you need a solid. So to analyze the structure of a protein you need a solid crystal of that protein. Although the process of crystallization is a phase change, which drastically changes the dynamics of the molecule, and it's local environment. So how do we know that the process of crystallizing a protein does not change it's structure? We don't have crystals of protein in our body, particularly the proteins that are working and doing their job in a cell. They are in the cytoplasm, or blood, etc. So, why is there so much confidence in these protein structures when we have discovered them from a solid state crystal of the protein while proteins are not in solid form in their typical environment?"

What an absolute mind blowing video!! the storyline combining all the hard works by scientists to new breakthroughs was a masterclass. I am a wiser person than who I was before watching this video.
"People, I know that many of you already understand this, but please remember that AI is not just LLMs (Large Language Models) like ChatGPT, or image generators like DALL-E, or music generators like Suno. AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to a broad field of computer science that includes algorithms and systems capable of making decisions, recognizing patterns, or solving problems based on input data. It can be from a simple rule-based system to a complex deep learning model.
For example:
Spam filters
Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
Autocorrect & predictive text
Recommendation algorithm (YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Tiktok)
Self-driving cars
Chatbots & customer support bots
Facial recognition
Search engines (Google, Bing)
Game AI (NPC or enemy behavior, etc.)

Those are all AI, but they use different approaches. They're not a type of AI that you can have a conversation with. And AI has existed since before personal computers were invented."

"There is a key aspect of proteins that is continually left out in a lot of similar discussions, and that is protein dynamics.  In many cases, solving a stable protein structure for some environment is enough.  There were multiple examples in this video.  But this is not the case for large numbers of proteins.  Post-translational modifications generally affect the shape of the protein from relatively small changes to drastic changes in protein configurations.  A simple example is that of a hinge.  An active domain of a protein could be hidden in its typical configuration, but if you add a negative charge to some regulatory domain of the protein, this charge can swing the protein open such that its active domain is exposed and able to perform some reaction.

There are many examples of this type of behaviour.  Even the motor protein shown in the beginning of the video demonstrates how dynamic protein structure can be.  Moreover, there are unordered domains in proteins that play many different roles, in some cases analogous to how an emulsifier facilitates water and oil mixing.

Another critical factor is protein-protein complexes.  Proteins can exist in large complexes of dozens of proteins.  These complexes themselves can be dynamical, meaning the specific proteins in the complex can be regulated over time and the various covalent modifications to these proteins as well.  All of these changes affect function.

Thinking about biology as a machine like  would build only takes you so far.  In the end, it is a useful analogy to start to learn biology but must be relinquished over time.

Alphafold is truly wondrous, but it is the first step into this dynamical world.  To build more complex biological programs, we need dynamical control of the proteins.  THis means we need to know the distribution of a proteins configurations and their likelihoods.  We also need to know how adding charges or other molecules to the protein can change their shape and potential their function.  Then we need to model how proteins change shape when non-covalently interacting with other molecules like proteins or small molecules.

This level of knowledge will allow us to affect a more encompassing range  of protein behaviour, all of which is critical in the functioning of cells."
So are the folding at home projects obsolete now?
I’m sorry but this just makes me believe in Darwinian even less now.
I can't help but get the feeling this is larger than we currently understand.

"The only sad thing is the amount of resources and all the carbon emitted by all the equipment needed to train the algorithms. 
I think when using really heavy AI like LLMs and deep algorithms we have to be really careful on who benefits of what - because as it was mentioned on this video. Googles computational power allowed an already powerful company a somewhat ""unfair"" advantage in terms of resources to have been considered for the Nobel price. Otherwise the power structures will get even worse benefiting the powerful."

Of course these AI can also be used to create bioweapons.
"Everything that were and still being discovered and or invented were meant to be for the goodness of all and the world.  However.   There Will Always someone powerful enough, greedy enough and selfish enough this will hijack it. Turn it into either a weapon and or means of oppression and control.   So, sometimes, it is a better idea not to have new things as some information are more  poisonous than help. AI is one of these things.  With just the infantile stage of AI, and we have already losing our humanity.   We can’t really tell what’s real, what’s not.  We can’t tell who’s real, and who’s fake."
"It is absolutely mindboggling and gives me hope at the same time for humanity of what we as a species are capable of

Can we just focus on that for a brief moment in between all the other stuff going on in this universe?"
So our proteins are basically random until something worked? Not built from the ground up? Is there a way for AI to create simplified versions of proteins that can replace the ones our bodies currently create? I'd be curious if there are health benefits to adding simplicity?
Gave me chills man
"I wish i discovered something named ""Turd of the century""."

"As a former biology student turned software developer, now leveraging AI in my products and working for a company that builds AI solutions, I can confidently say that this video is not only an eye-opener to AI's true potential, but also a revelation that one of biochemistry’s biggest challenges has been solved—and made trivial. Thank you, Veritasium, for this enlightening video."
1:00 The video was amazing just one request please use the traditional way of showing the molecule I mean please show the molecule using structural formula or bond line formula as most of us are familiar with that not with this 3D model so please in upcoming videos use these methods too. Thank you love your videos
thanks to stats and maths
"Amortality is 10 years away, maybe 20 to the poors"
How do you produce the proteins
Science is a beautiful thing
Remember that violence is an indicator of lack of intelligence. Not an indicator of intelligence. This means that true intelligence of any kind would always be non-violent. It would find ways of altering the genetics and biology of those who are ignorant / stupid/lacking... And just make them better people on a genetic level and then work on who they are as a person after the genetic therapy has taken effect. Any truly intelligent AI would go about those means instead of any means of violence. It would find ways of benefiting us and therefore causing us to be willing to benefit it.
"9:36 Actually, Evolution says, “If it don’t work, you die.”"
i am really sorry for the fact that you really believe in evolution

"Or, hear me out, we can use AI to deny health insurance claims."
"I remember donating processor/gpu time to folding proteins back in the day. I should have been mining bitcoin instead, as it turned out. 10s of thousands of dollars per protein structure. For what? It's not immediately profitable. It's to build a foundation for future research. How does something that isn't immediately profitable going to get funding? Well, that's where government comes in and gives money for research to scientists at places like... Harvard, MIT, Duke, etc etc etc. So when someone say we are giving tax payer money to a university, it's not necessarily all going where you think it's going especially if that is a fully private university. The government spent untold amounts of money on the foundations of the internet. It took decades for that investment to actually pay off and no one realized how big it would pay off."
"It's funny that back to back sentences here are ""it's totally nonsensical structure, not anything like humans would build like an engine"" and then ""even with 200x the age of the universe testing 30k variations every nano second you wouldn't find the working structure""

Yet here we are with millions of different structures. Thank God for completely random chance finding millions of impossible configurations within an infinitely (relatively) small amount of time."
Now imagine where we'd be if the bulk of investment in AI was in stuff like this and not stealing art and creating misinformation.
"""Evolution didn't design proteins from the ground up."" True, but you could also stop after the first three words."
"Ai is but another tool. Nothing more than another type of chisel to create new things with. It shouldn’t be used for entertainment, but for research purposes. Testing, simulating, creating new technologies that can benefit people"
how can you dislike this video
"You're a creator, you should know better than to shill generative AI."
"Thank you for this great video. AI is an incredibly powerful tool in science and I really hope we will be able to solve some major problems with its help, like curing cancer one day."
Couldn't have completed my research project without alphafold
Can ai solve the manufacturing of artificial blood.

At Solving cLimate cHange I just went ohhhhh..
"Humanity is the cradle of gods.,. For if they don't exist, we will make them.
Forge a new being so Far beyond humanity we can only call them gods.
Erase the plagues of age, cancer and more..
This is the first step to the future, and in the next melenium we might not be able to call humanity human for much longer."
"Once again, AI showing that it's much better when doing something tedious and boring. Wish more people let AI do these boring jobs, so we can focus on making art. Not letting AI make the art."
This is amazing! Gives me hope for the world. We need it....
06:51 It's always hilarious when nerds try to look cool.
"Hear me out, Majorana 1 crossed with AlphaFold 2"
Why are people afraid of AI. Adding intelligence to any problem tends to solve them.
Really awesome chapter
"I don't know about others, but as for me, I'm very thankful to be living at a time of such amazing medical science and still around to enjoy all its' benefits. What an amazing breakthrough in understanding life's protein building blocks!"
"Hopefully these kinds of programmes won't get ""DOGEd"", but for stupidity in chief there's no help from ai."
"design awards should go to the designer of the ai program itself and to the team that designed the protocol to utilize the designed ai program to discover the designed structure of the protein molecules themselves. oops. sorry. that last part should read 'to discover the accidentally-formed structure of the protein molecules themselves'. (forgot the scientific rule: 'if humans did not invent it, it was not invented'.)"
فباي آلاء ربكما تكذبان 1:35
You need to update your understanding of evolution... a 1000 amino acid protein has 1000^20 (10^60) possible combinations and only a very few of those possibilities will be useful.  The number of atoms in the universe is something like 10^80.  It is not possible for evolution to be the sole explanation for life.

Amazing Mark! Do you know any other languages?

"This video helped me realize that with the many space launches that happen I always imagine them being a one time event and once one thing breaks or doesn’t work, then that’s the end of the mission. I didn’t realize that you can still troubleshoot while the mission is going on, working towards the completion, even when there are failures along the way. Well done, Mark! I hope to be able to send my picture in soon to you. I’m getting married next year in February. So I’m crossing my fingers that will be able to see our selfie with earth."
"This is awesome 
Thank you"
how did you know of the success of the first three operations if communication was the fourth one?

Question about static electricity. I have kitchen scales that are unable to work because I sifted flour into a stainless steel bowl causing static electricity to zap my scale. Is there anyway to fix these scales?  I've wrecked 10 scales with this issue!

You're actually a superhero for me Mark Rober. In this video I felt like I'm living a dream. Thanks for everything.
Thanks Mark Rober for bringing this wonderful thing to us.
"I don't know how Mark is able to juggle all of the projects that he does. From working on crunch labs, hack pack, this crazy space selfie mission and still uploading videos to the channel. All of them are difficult things to do individually. Hats of to him!"
"A big salute to your curiosity and hard-working mindset, your positive attitude keeps me motivated. You made history by launching this project. Congratulations on this big achievement  , Love from India"

"You're awesome Mark. When I was a kid growing up in the 90's, all I wanted to do was invent things. I was obsessed. You made your dreams come true. You give these kids today a huge opportunity to learn and explore their minds in a way that we never had in the 90's. I love everything you do Mark. Incredible stuff brother."

"Mark Rober just redefined what YouTube should be in 2025: turning childhood dreams into reality, sending selfies to space, and proving that with science, passion, and $5 million, even a squirrel can make history. Thank you for the inspiration, the tears, and the reminder that 'impossible' is just another challenge to solve."

I won't understand this world if they don't make a movie about Mark. He's a real hero and role model.
